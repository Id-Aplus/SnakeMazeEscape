# üêç SnakeMazeEscape ‚Äì Developer Log

This is the full development breakdown for my submission to the **Build Games Challenge** using **Python**, **Pygame**, and **Amazon Q Developer CLI (inside VS Code)**.

> üìå *Amazon Q Developer helped me brainstorm, generate code snippets, fix bugs, and improve logic through iterative prompting. Its AI-assisted coding was central to this project.*

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Project Structure

Initial folder layout:

üìÅ SnakeMazeEscape/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ maze.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snake.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enemy.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sound_manager.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sounds/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/

bash
Copy
Edit

Created using command line:

```bash
mkdir SnakeMazeEscape
cd SnakeMazeEscape
echo. > main.py
echo. > maze.py
echo. > snake.py
echo. > enemy.py
mkdir assets
‚úÖ Step 3: Game Window and Maze Skeleton
Prompt to Q:
"Create a Pygame window with a game loop and a randomly generated maze."

Generated Output:

Functional 800x600 window at 60 FPS

Placeholder maze

Static snake and enemy

python
Copy
Edit
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.running = True
‚úÖ Step 4: Maze + Snake Mechanics
Replaced grid blocks with a recursive backtracking maze. Snake now moves automatically with proper wall detection and reversal behavior.

python
Copy
Edit
def generate_maze():
    grid = [[1 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    def carve(x, y):
        grid[y][x] = 0
        dirs = [(0,2), (2,0), (-2,0), (0,-2)]
        random.shuffle(dirs)
        for dx, dy in dirs:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 < nx < cols-1 and 0 < ny < rows-1 and grid[ny][nx] == 1:
                grid[y + dy//2][x + dx//2] = 0
                carve(nx, ny)
‚úÖ Step 5: Combat System + Ammo
Food = Ammo

Shooting uses ammo (Spacebar)

Bullet launches from tail

Enemy health + stun logic

python
Copy
Edit
def shoot(self):
    if self.ammo > 0:
        self.bullets.append({'x': self.head_x, 'y': self.head_y, 'dir': self.direction})
        self.ammo -= 1
        self.sound_manager.play('shoot')
python
Copy
Edit
def check_hit(self, bullets):
    for bullet in bullets:
        if self.rect.colliderect(bullet['rect']):
            self.health -= 1
            self.stunned = True
            self.stun_timer = pygame.time.get_ticks()
‚úÖ Step 6: Sound System
Full audio mapping:

BGM + SFX (shoot.wav, eat.wav, win.mp3, etc.)

Background music looped from assets/sounds/BGM.mp3

python
Copy
Edit
class SoundManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.mixer.init()
        self.sounds = {
            'shoot': 'assets/sounds/shoot.wav',
            ...
        }
        pygame.mixer.music.load('assets/sounds/BGM.mp3')
        pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)
‚úÖ Step 7: Fullscreen Integration
Fullscreen toggle added via menu (not F11)

Proper scaling, screen-centering, and aspect ratio

Does not interfere with window switching

python
Copy
Edit
def toggle_fullscreen(self):
    info = pygame.display.Info()
    width, height = info.current_w, info.current_h
    self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height), pygame.FULLSCREEN)
‚úÖ Step 8: Menu System Implementation
Prompt to Q:
"Create a professional game menu with difficulty selection, timer, and sound settings."

Menu Features:

Difficulty: Easy / Normal / Advanced

Timer: Custom duration (or none)

Sound toggles: Music & SFX

‚ÄúHow to Play‚Äù screen

Fullscreen toggle

Exit Game option

python
Copy
Edit
class MainMenu:
    def __init__(self, screen, sound_manager):
        self.menu_options = ["Start Game", "Select Difficulty", "Set Timer", 
                             "How to Play", "Music", "SFX", "Exit Game"]
‚úÖ Step 9: Game State Management
Game States:

Main Menu

Playing

Victory

Game Over

Time-Up

python
Copy
Edit
def update_game_state(self):
    if self.maze.is_exit(self.snake.head_x, self.snake.head_y):
        self.sound_manager.play('victory')
        self.game_state = 'victory'
    elif enemy_collision:
        self.sound_manager.play('game_over')
        self.game_state = 'game_over'

üß™ Final Bug Fixes
‚úÖ Fixed:

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Normal/Advanced Modes):
Instant "Game Over" on replay

Game ends even when enemy hasn‚Äôt touched snake

Timer and enemy spawn overlap in replay loops

üß† Development Philosophy
I wanted a unique game that combined retro roots with modern mechanics. Instead of recreating an old Snake clone, I built a system that:

Challenges player reflex and memory

Explores AI-assisted development with Amazon Q

Fuses shooting, evasion, and procedural logic

‚ÄúA game should feel alive ‚Äî even in early builds.‚Äù

This project evolved naturally through prompt brainstorming, debug feedback, and clean architectural design. I‚Äôm proud of what it became ‚Äî and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it.
